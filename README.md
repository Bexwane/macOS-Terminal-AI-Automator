**Install**


chmod +x scripts/*.py    # Make scripts executable

or if you're confused, just simply put the scripts (ag.py and ai.py) in your home folder ( for example Users/davidpearson/ )

 and run these commands:
 
chmod +x ~/ai.py
chmod +x ~/ag.py

To use the AI features, you need a Groq API key:
	Sign up and get your API key â†’ [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
	Open your shell config file:

nano ~/.zshrc


	Add this line (replace YOUR_KEY with your actual key):

export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"


	Save and reload your shell:

source ~/.zshrc



âœ… Now the scripts can access your API key automatically.

Reload your shell:

source ~/.zshrc

 Now just type:

ai "what's the command to check disk space?"
ag "compress all PDFs in Documents"

ai "Give me a Python script to batch rename files"
ai "Show me how to list files sorted by size"

ag "Create 5 folders in Desktop and put a text file in each"
ag "Zip all images in Pictures"
